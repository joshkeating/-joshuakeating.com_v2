								This was an end of course project that I worked with a team on for Info 201 (Technical Foundations). Using a
								dataset comprised of
								the anonymized grade data from every class taught at the University of Washington (Seattle) from Autumn 2010 to
								Winter 2016, we built
								an interactive web application. To manipulate the (relatively large ~40,000 lines, 20 features) dataset I used
								R to wrangle and filter the data
								into subsets that could be visualized. We used Shiny to create a reactive user interface that allows the user
								to filter the data for a specific class
								and display interactive visualizations.

								Motivations
							</h4>
							<p>
								When deciding what kind of dataset to tackle, we came to the conclusion that we wanted to work with a dataset
								that
								would be relevant to current University of Washington students. After searching around we stumbled upon this
								particular dataset
								and were intrigued. It was relevant (because who wants to take a class with an unnecessarily tough teacher) and
								it was more than complex enough.
								Specifically, we were most interested in the distribution and breakdown of the letter grades within each class.
								The data is anonymized and could
								be manipulated to highlight features that are important to current UW students.
							</p>

							<h4 class="article-subheading">
								How We Built It
							</h4>
							<p>
								To manipulate the data I used the excellent <a class="about_links" href="https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html">dplyr</a>
								package which was
								nested inside a <a class="about_links" href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> reactive function. This
								allowed user inputs to filter the data on the fly. Changing the dataset dynamically
								based on user input and then displaying it over on the UI turned out to be tougher than I expected but this was
								the code that got it to work.
								<pre class="codeblock">
# initalize Shiny text input widget
output$value <&#45; renderPrint({ input$text })

# Reactive function that wrangles the dataset based on the user input from the  widget
datasetInput <&#45; reactive({
    
	# filters the data using dplyr based on the input text
	trimmed.course <&#45; filter(gpa, Class == toupper(input$text))

	return trimmed.course
})</pre>
								This returns a dataframe that can be passed into a render function on the server side: <code class="inlinecode">output$plot <&#45; renderPlotly({ggplotly(datasetInput())})</code>
								and then
								passed into an output over in the UI.
							</p>


							<p>
								To build the plot I used the <a class="about_links" href="https://plot.ly/">plotly</a> library which
								does a great job of creating beautiful interactive visualizations. We set up a Shiny server thanks to the free
								hosting that they offer so that anyone with an internet connection can take a look at what we made.
								You can check the site <a class="about_links" href="https://joshkeating.shinyapps.io/info-201-coursegrades/">here</a>
