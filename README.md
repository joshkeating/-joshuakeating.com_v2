# Personal Website

Made with pure `HTML` and `CSS` because you shouldn't need to use Javascript for a site like this.

No frontend frameworks or Google analytics == no bullshit. The only CDN calls that are made are for fonts.

Only tested on Gecko and Blink based browsers, if you're using IE, treat yourself to a modern web browser.
