                            What Got Me Interested
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            I got interested in browser architecture when I was taking a software architecture course
                            (INFO 498) at school. Intrigued by the complexity of the modern browser, I ended up making
                            a couple of extensions for Firefox and Chrome. This ended up being a pretty great way to
                            learn (at some level) how these programs worked.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="article-subheading">
                            Historical Context
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Chrome was designed with a multiprocess architecture in mind whereas Firefox has added
                            default multiprocess support only recently. Google realized earlier than Mozilla (‘07,08)
                            that multicore processors were the future. Using parallelism the Chrome dev team was able
                            to build a browser that ran each tab in a separate process. This type of architecture lends
                            itself to the sandboxed design that Chrome is built around. By late 2017 Firefox had seen
                            the light and released Firefox Quantum, which incorporated a number of modernizing features
                            including the parallelised multiprocess architecture.

                        <h4 class="article-subheading">
                            Why This Works So Well
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            At a high level, these browsers are comprised of a number of components that work together
                            to create a stable, performant, and secure piece of software. Across both Firefox and
                            Chrome, webpages that run into issues will not disrupt the entire browser. Sandboxed,
                            multiprocess tabs that fail can be killed safely. Multiprocess allows for I/O to be done
                            asynchronously or split among additional threads to increase disk access availability.

                            Architecture Analysis
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Chrome/Firefox uses multiple architectural styles under their overarching multi-process
                            architecture. If forced to give a label, the N-tier architecture might be suitable as a
                            generalization. A subset of a layered/tiered architecture, the N-tier style is a type of
                            multilayered architecture where the presentation, processing, business and data management
                            levels areseparated. N-tier is not confined to any set number of layers and can be expanded
                            to any number of possible layers. In the instance of Chrome/Firefox, the User Interface as
                            the Presentation tier works with the Browser component alongside rendering engine as the
                            Logic tier to handle the view and interaction with the web.

                            Where Extensions Fit In
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Extensions are a way to add functionality to the browser that does not exist in its base
                            state. By defining extensions outside of the Browser and WebKit/Gecko components, the
                            browsermaintains its sandboxed, decoupled approach to architecture. Each extension is run
                            in its own process and are created with the use of the Browser logic. Chrome/Firefox has
                            it's ownframework of defining extensions that are used in the browser. Extensions are
                            assigned a limited amount of responsibility and access based on an opt-in basis. At a high
                            level, an extension in Chrome/Firefox needs to interface with at least one of the current
                            tabs in the session. Extensions are architected in such a way so that the extension will
                            registers callbacks to the browser for a specific situation using a defined interface.
                            Based on the interface, the tab will change its content.

                            Website Navigation Extension
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Around the same time I started learning about browser architecture I was inspired to write
                            a couple of web extensions. These were primarily intended to be used for sped up navigation
                            of websites I frequent regularly. You can find the <a class="about_links" href="https://github.com/joshkeating/jk-nav-ff">source
                                code</a> of these published on Github
                            and read more about them there.
