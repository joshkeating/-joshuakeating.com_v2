								Introduction
							</h4>
							<p>
								This was an end of course project that I worked on at UW that focused on the effects that the reinstitution of
								the Mexico City Policy could have on women's health in Sub-Saharan African communities. The project focused on
								three major concerns; the impact of the policy on reproductive health, abortion rates, and funding for
								non-governmental organizations focused on family planning.
							</p>

								Abstract
							</h4>
							<p>
								The recent restoration of the Mexico City policy has brought the issue of U.S. federal funding
								fornon-governmental organisations (NGOs) to the forefront of the public consciousness. The conflictlies in the
								policy’s mandate that NGOs that receive federal funds agree to neither perform noractively promote abortion as
								a method of family planning. This means that any organization thatwishes to continue to receive US funding must
								cease to provide abortion related services such as; education, family planning, counseling, and training if
								they wish to keep their federal funding.This has the potential to disrupt important health care services,
								including maternal health care in regions of the world where additional funding is most needed. In our research
								we looked atsome of the current and historical levels of contraceptive use, family planning methods in specific
								regions, maternal mortality and induced abortion rates, and the flow of federal funds into some of the largest
								NGOs.
