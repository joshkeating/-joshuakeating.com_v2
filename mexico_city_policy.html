The project focused on three major concerns the impact of the policy on reproductive health, abortion rates, and funding for non-governmental organizations focused on family planning.</p><h2 class="post-subheading">Abstract</h2><p>The recent restoration of the Mexico City policy has brought the issue of U.S. federal funding for non-governmental organisations NGOs to the forefront of the public consciousness. The conflict lies in the policy's mandate that NGOs that receive federal funds agree to neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning. This means that any organization that wishes to continue to receive US funding must cease to provide abortion related services such as education, family planning, counseling, and training if they wish to keep their federal funding.This has the potential to disrupt important health care services, including maternal health care in regions of the world where additional funding is most needed. In our research we looked atsome of the current and historical levels of contraceptive use, family planning methods in specific regions, maternal mortality and induced abortion rates, and the flow of federal funds into some of the largest NGOs.</p><img class="img-responsive" src="../res/images/abortion_rates.png" alt="Abortion rates"><h2 class="post-subheading">Paper and Website</h2><p>If this sounds interesting, I encourage you to read the <a class="std-link" href="../res/pdfs/mexico_city_paper.pdf">full academic paper</a> and check out the <a class="std-link" href="https://joshkeating.shinyapps.io/global-gag-rule/">Shiny website</a> we built for the project.</p></article></main><footer><p>Â© 2016-2020 Joshua Keating.
